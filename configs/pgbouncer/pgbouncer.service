# Example systemd service unit for PgBouncer
#
# - Adjust the paths in ExecStart for your installation.
#
# - The User setting requires careful consideration.  PgBouncer needs
#   to be able to place a Unix-domain socket file where PostgreSQL
#   clients will look for it.  In the olden days, this was in /tmp,
#   but systems using systemd now prefer something like
#   /var/run/postgresql/.  But then some systems also lock down that
#   directory so that only the postgres user can write to it.  That
#   means you either need to run PgBouncer as the postgres user, or
#   you create a separate user and add it to the postgres group and
#   make /var/run/postgresql/ group-writable.  For packagers and
#   deployment systems, this requires delicate coordination between
#   the PgBouncer and the PostgreSQL packages/components.  There is no
#   single satisfactory answer right now.
